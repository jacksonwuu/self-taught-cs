Documenting my self-learning experience.

### What I am Learning right now?

- [MIT 6.828 Operating System Engineering](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2018/schedule.html)

- [MIT 6.824 Distributed Systems](http://nil.lcs.mit.edu/6.824/2020/schedule.html)

- [CMU 15-721 Advanced Database Systems](https://15721.courses.cs.cmu.edu/spring2020/schedule.html)

- [SU CS144 Introduction to Computer Networking](https://cs144.github.io/)



- Assembly Language

As a programmer, I found that learning assembly language is pretty much helpful. Learning assembly make me grasp a deeper understanding of what high language code actually do, how registers works and how Operating System works.

MIT 6.828 course strongly recommend a book about x86 assembly, [PC Assembly Language](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2018/readings/pcasm-book.pdf), Iâ€˜ve read through, it's a really a great book!
