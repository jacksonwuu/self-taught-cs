# Self-taught Computer Science

Documenting my self-learning experience.

What I am Learning right now?

- Assembly Language

As a programmer, I found that learning assembly language is pretty much helpful. Learning assembly make me grasp a deeper understanding of what high language code actually do, how registers works and how Operating System works.

MIT 6.828 course strongly recommend a book about x86 assembly, [PC Assembly Language](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2018/readings/pcasm-book.pdf), Iâ€˜ve read through, it's a really a great book!
